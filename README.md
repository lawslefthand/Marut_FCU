# Marut - STM32 F4XX Blackpill Based Fixed Wing + Multirotor FCU

**Marut** is an advanced Flight Control Unit (FCU) being developed at **AISSMS IOIT** in collaboration with **Team Aeroguardians**. It combines cutting-edge control algorithms, real-time telemetry, and autonomous navigation for both fixed-wing and quadrotor aircraft. Built for precision, reliability, and innovation, Marut aims to set a new standard in UAV flight control research and development.

This project is a collaborative initiative between **Team Aeroguardians** of the IoIT Drone Club and the **Catalyst Committee** to develop an indigenous Flight Control Unit (FCU). The aim is to advance drone and UAV development within the college by providing a **custom-designed, locally developed FCU right from the very core**.

## License

This project is **open for collaboration within the institution**.
